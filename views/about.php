                            <p><span style="color: #444444;">Made with pure cane sugar and featuring the most unique packaging in the beverage industry, Jones Soda is a one of a kind premium soda known for its bold, unique flavors, colors, and ever changing labels submitted by our consumers. Jones Soda is truly your brand!</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #444444;">Created in Vancouver, BC in 1995 from the vision of Jones Soda founder, Peter van Stolk, and photographer/designer Victor John Penner, Jones was launched with the idea of incorporating random photographs onto our bottles using shots taken by Penner. But when consumers began submitting their own photos, we quickly realized that user sourced participation made the brand even more special.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #444444;">Our flavor lineup includes traditional favorites like Root Beer, Cream Soda &amp; Orange &amp; Cream, but we also offer tasty, unique options such as Blue Bubblegum, Green Apple, Strawberry Lime and Fufu Berry. And of course, we are always working on new, limited release ideas to keep our fans smiling. Who can forget Turkey &amp; Gravy Soda or Bacon Soda? And most recently, we introduced Poutine Soda, which was a big hit with our Canadian fans up north!</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #444444;">The Jones portfolio includes Jones Pure Cane Soda, Jones Zilch (our zero calorie line), and Jones Stripped, which is a brand new line of natural, sparkling sodas. We are proud of the wide selection of products in our lineup, as we truly offer something different to suit the interests of all our enthusiastic consumers.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #444444;">And our caps! Our fans love the quotes they find under Jones Soda caps, which offer pearls of wisdom, advice, or simple daily pick me ups. Collected and shared through social media, our caps have become nearly as synonymous with our brand as our photos, and are part of what makes us who we are. And just in case you werenâ€™t already aware, our caps can also be collected and sent back to Jones to redeem some pretty cool prizes.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #444444;">People always ask where they can find Jones in their neighborhoods. Depending on where you live, that may or may not be an easy question to answer. We are working hard to ensure Jones can be found in as many traditional and nontraditional retailers as possible. But for those who have trouble trying to find us, we also offer our products for sale through our website, where our business continues to grow!</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #444444;">We may be the little guy in the giant soda pop world, but we are proud and passionate about what we do and who we represent.</span></p>
